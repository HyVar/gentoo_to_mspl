# hyvar for reconfiguring gentoo

Structure of the repository:

* guest: contains the script to save in the gentoo VM

* host: contains the code needed for the translation and computation of the new configuration
   - portage
      * portage.tar.bz2: copied from guest
      * usr: generated by uncompress-portage.sh
      * json
         1. mspl: generated by uncompress-portage.sh
         2. spl: generated by uncompress-portage.sh
         3. hyvarrec: generated by ....
   - configuration:
      * configuration.gz: copied from guest
      * world.gz: copied from guest 
      * json
         1. configuration.json: generated by uncompress-configuration.sh (current configuration)
         2. world: generated by uncompress-configuration.sh (this is the concatenation of user requests)
   - scripts: directory containing ulitity scripts and src 
   - uncompress-portage.sh
   - uncompress-configuration.sh
   - portage2hyvarrec.sh
   - run-hyvarrec.sh
      

 
  




TODO
----------------------
The VM of Gentoo used is available from https://www.osboxes.org/gentoo/

In particular the system was tested with Gentoo 201703 (CLI Minimal) - 64bit.

Note that the sshd service in the virtual machine needs to be started

```
service sshd start
```

``` 
Username: osboxes
Password: osboxes.org
Password for Root account: osboxes.org
```

Then to access the machine configure VirtualBox with a NAT and use ssh.
Assuming that the port 22 of the VM has been redirected to port 9022

```
ssh -p 9022 -o PubkeyAuthentication=no osboxes@localhost
```

To copy the files and extract the configuration and the portage tree structure the following commands need to be
executed from the gentoo_to_mspl directory.
```
scp -o PubkeyAuthentication=no -P 9022  -r guest/*  osboxes@localhost:
ssh -p 9022 -o PubkeyAuthentication=no osboxes@localhost 'echo osboxes.org | sudo -S ~/hyvar/compress-configuration.sh'
ssh -p 9022 -o PubkeyAuthentication=no osboxes@localhost 'echo osboxes.org | sudo -S ~/hyvar/compress-portage.sh'

scp -o PubkeyAuthentication=no -P 9022  osboxes@localhost:/home/osboxes/hyvar/gen/portage.tar.bz2 host/portage
scp -o PubkeyAuthentication=no -P 9022  osboxes@localhost:/home/osboxes/hyvar/gen/world.gz host/configuration
scp -o PubkeyAuthentication=no -P 9022  osboxes@localhost:/home/osboxes/hyvar/gen/configuration.gz host/configuration
```

Then when the files are saved to translate the files the following commands need to be exectued.
```
cd host
```
